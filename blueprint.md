- [ ] **Customizable Data Models**
     - [ ] Allow users to define their own mock data schemas (e.g., with JSON Schema or similar tools), so they can simulate any kind of API response, not just predefined user data.
     - [ ] Provide a web interface where developers can create their own data structures and easily generate mock responses.
   
   - [ ] **Realistic API Simulation**
     - [ ] Add support for simulating various HTTP status codes, including complex cases like rate limiting (e.g., 429), authentication errors (401, 403), or server errors (500).
     - [ ] Include customizable response delays to simulate slower or intermittent server responses, helping developers test handling of timeouts and retries.
   
   - [ ] **Dynamic Data Generation**
     - [ ] Integrate with a library like Faker to allow the generation of random but realistic data (user names, addresses, emails, etc.) for more varied mock responses.
     - [ ] Support “stateful” APIs where data can persist across requests, letting users simulate changes over time (e.g., a user profile update or item in a shopping cart).
   
   - [ ] **File Upload/Download Mocking**
     - [ ] Provide support for testing file uploads and downloads, which is useful for APIs that require handling file-based data.
     - [ ] Allow users to upload sample files that can be retrieved in future responses, mimicking an actual file storage service.
   
   - [ ] **Authentication and Authorization Mocking**
     - [ ] Include the ability to simulate various authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth2, Basic Auth) and allow users to mock responses based on authenticated or unauthenticated requests.
     - [ ] Create endpoints for simulating login, token refresh, and user roles (admin, user, guest) to test access control.
   
   - [ ] **Advanced Request Handling**
     - [ ] Implement support for conditionally responding to requests based on parameters, headers, or request body content.
     - [ ] Allow URL query parameters, request body, or header values to trigger different responses for more dynamic and complex testing.
   
   - [ ] **Performance Testing Support**
     - [ ] Allow developers to simulate load testing with a large number of requests, providing insights on API performance under stress.
     - [ ] Include options for throttling requests, simulating network latency, and randomly returning various response codes to test API resilience.
   
   - [ ] **Version Control**
     - [ ] Support multiple versions of the same API so that users can test different versions of an API in parallel without interference.
     - [ ] Provide a way to easily manage backward compatibility, deprecations, and version migrations.
   
   - [ ] **Webhooks and Real-time Events**
     - [ ] Allow users to create endpoints that trigger webhooks or simulate real-time events, like notifications, message queues, or push notifications.
     - [ ] Include basic integrations with popular platforms (e.g., Slack, GitHub, Discord) for sending real-time updates.
   
   - [ ] **API Documentation Generation**
     - [ ] Automatically generate API documentation based on the mock responses and data structures, making it easier for developers to understand the available endpoints.
     - [ ] Provide options to export documentation in various formats like Swagger or OpenAPI for easy integration with existing development tools.
   
   - [ ] **Collaboration and Sharing**
     - [ ] Enable sharing of mock APIs and data models with team members or the broader developer community.
     - [ ] Allow users to import and export configurations or use predefined templates for popular API types (e.g., RESTful, GraphQL, gRPC).
     - [ ] Integrate with project management or CI/CD tools for seamless collaboration and integration into the development workflow.
   
   - [ ] **Integration with Frontend and Backend Frameworks**
     - [ ] Offer libraries or SDKs for popular frontend and backend frameworks, allowing developers to integrate mock API calls directly into their codebase for easy testing without setting up a separate mock server.
   
   - [ ] **Real-Time Analytics and Logs**
     - [ ] Provide analytics on the API usage, such as number of requests, most frequent endpoints, response times, and error rates, helping teams optimize their mock APIs for testing.
